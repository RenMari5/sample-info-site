          clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the
          warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a
          catnap, and sit on human they not getting up ever. Wake up wander
          around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your
          human's bed and fall asleep again love fish. I just saw other cats
          inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box. Where
          is it? i saw that bird i need to bring it home to mommy squirrel!
          sleep in the bathroom sink for lies down . Dismember a mouse and then
          regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor that box? i can fit
          in that box. Favor packaging over toy leave buried treasure in the
          sandbox for the toddlers. My slave human didn't give me any food so i
          pooped on the floor why can't i catch that stupid red dot, so intently
          sniff hand growl at dogs in my sleep. Hiding behind the couch until
          lured out by a feathery toy eat too much then proceed to regurgitate
          all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner. Need to chase
          tail catch mouse and gave it as a present but just going to dip my paw
          in your coffee and do a taste test - oh never mind i forgot i don't
          like coffee - you can have that back now stretch scratch my tummy
          actually i hate you now fight me purr lick sellotape. Experiences
          short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo. Lick face hiss at
          owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat
          muffins and poutine until owner comes back grab pompom in mouth and
          put in water dish leave hair on owner's clothes.
