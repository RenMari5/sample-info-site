          clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the
          warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a
          catnap, and sit on human they not getting up ever. Wake up wander

          regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor that box? i can fit
          in that box. Favor packaging over toy leave buried treasure in the
          sandbox for the toddlers.
